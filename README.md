Solace
======

Solace is an open source runescape emulation project undertaken by myself as firstly, a means of learning and practice, secondly to hopefully come up with a far better alternative to the current prominent RSPS frameworks in use today. 
I aim to offer the high end performance and speed achieved by frameworks such as Apollo and Hyperion, yet to still maintain a relatively simple and easy to navigate code base for new comers.
Taking into account it is my first framework build I do hope I don't bite off more than I can chew with the grandness of the goals I aim to accomplish, but I can only strive for as best as I can possible create.

This project will be 100% available to anyone and everybody during build and post build, it will be released in a neat, use friendly package for those who want to wait for the its official licensed release (hopefully I do get to this stage)
otherwise for the few of you who are familiar with GitHub, you can download the project from there and make of it what you will. For the opening few days, I will be looking at a lot of different frameworks, and using them as a reference
as well as selecting ideas from some of the best and putting them into practice on Solace. You can consider it, if all goes well... A fusion of ideas from good frameworks as well as having my own twist on these. And the majority of game play design
 has already been done by myself and it seems to be following a fairly straightforward, traditional style. With the exception of a high amount of pre-incorporated abstraction and systems so once released, content will be a breeze to add on to.
